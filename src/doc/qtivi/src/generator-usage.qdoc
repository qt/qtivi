This page is about the usage of the QtIVI auto-generator.

\section1 Introduction

The Generator is a Python script that can be run manually or using the qmake integration (see \l
{Qmakeintegration}). This script uses QFace as the autogenerator framework which parses the IDL
file, generates the domain-model (similar to AST) and then feeds it to the actual generator.
Depending on the type of the generated project, different \e{formats} are specified.

\section1 Command line parameters
The generation is run using the following command:
\code
$$[QT_HOST_BINS]/ivigenerator/generate.py interface.qface out_dir --format=backend_simulator
\endcode

The options and parameters are:
\table
    \row
        \li --reload / --no-reload [optional]
        \li specifies whether the generator should keep track of the changes in the IDL file
        and update output on the fly (--no-reload by default)
    \row
        \li  -f, --format [frontend|backend_simulator]
        \li see below
    \row
        \li --help
        \li Show options and exit.
    \row
        \li source
        \li Path or paths to the IDL source files. In case of multiple entries present, each one
        will be handled. In case a directory path is provided, it will be scanned for all the IDL
        files.
    \row
        \li outputdir
        \li Generation destination folder
\endtable

At the moment the generator is able to generate 2 kinds of projects given an interface IDL file
based on the \e {--format} option value.
These are:
\table
  \row
    \li frontend
    \li Generates a developer facing API using base classes from qtivicore and the \l {Dynamic
    Backend System}
  \row
    \li backend simulator
    \li Generates a simulation backend for the API generated by the "frontend" option. This
    backend serves as a mock implementation.
\endtable

\section1 YAML configuration

The Python script is responsible for parsing the input files and for the creation of a domain
model. This domain model is passed as a context to the Jinja template engine. To control which
files are generated, the "Generation YAML" can be used. In addition, an "Annotations YAML" can be
used to add more information to the IDL file, which are generator specific.

\section2 Generation YAML

After the domain model tree has been created, this tree is traversed and each leaf of the domain
model object tree (module, interface, structure, etc) is passed to a specific Jinja template
defined by the configuration file. This file must be in YAML format and for every particular
generation format its name is defined in the script. This file must have the following structure:

\code
generate_rules:
    module_rules:
        -   dest_file:  "{{module.module_name|lower}}plugin.h"
          template_file:  "plugin.h.tpl"
    interface_rules:
        -   dest_file: '{{interface|lower}}backend.h'
          template_file: 'backend.h.tpl'
    struct_rules:
\endcode

For every entity there is a list of templates needed to be called when traversing this entity
in the domain model tree. Here, \e{dest_file} is a name of the file need to be created specified in
the \l {Jinja template syntax}{Jinja template language} format: the value of the object property
used in the name template will be processed and substituted into the template, thus forming the
final name of the file to create. \e{dest_file} is a name of the template to be used. For the IVI
generator, rules for three kinds of entities need to be specified: modules, interfaces and
structures.

\section2 Annotations YAML

At the moment not all aspects of the interface description cannot be expressed using the IDL
itself. For instance there is no language construct to define default value for the property or
values the property can take on. Still this can be achieved via a mechanism called \l
{annotations_reference} {Annotations}. Annotations allow great freedom and flexibility of
expressing any concepts and constructs.

Below is an example of using annotations in the IDL. Here it's defined that interface is zoned and
its identifier is specified.

\code
@config: {zoned: true, id: "org.qt-project.qtivi.ClimateControl/1.2" }
\endcode

Not all of the annotations make sense to be put in the main IDL file either. For instance, one may
need to define some aspects of generation of the auto-testing code. Such annotations can be put in
the YAML file accompanying the main IDL file and named after it. During the parse phase
QFace picks this file up automatically and merges annotation specified in this YAML file with those
defined in the IDL file.

For QtIvi there are following annotations used for the IDL definition:

\table
    \header
        \li Tag
        \li Where
        \li Object type
        \li Purpose
    \row
        \li @config(zoned)
        \li Main IDL file
        \li Interface
        \li tells the generator whether the interface is zoned or not. This allows to define
        whether the backend feature interface is derived from QIviZonedFeatureInterface or from
        QIviFeatureInterface
    \row
        \li @config(id=org.qt.project.qtivi.ClimateControl.1.0)
        \li Main IDL file
        \li Interface
        \li defines the interface id. The id is a string used by the QtIvi service manager to glue
        frontend interface and backend implementation together. See \l {Dynamic Backend System}
        for more details.
    \row
        \li @config(getter_name)
        \li Main IDL file
        \li Property
        \li Overrides the default getter method name. Useful for boolean properties (for example, getter
        for property 'enabled', should be 'isEnabled' rather than the default).
    \row
        \li @config(setter_name)
        \li Main IDL file
        \li Property
        \li Overrides the default setter method name.
\endtable

The annotations that are not logically part of the interface description but rather the ones used
for specifying additional information are put in the accompanying YAML file. Here is the list of
annotations used for defining various aspects of the generation of the backend-simulator:

\table
    \header
        \li Tag
        \li Where
        \li Object type
        \li Purpose
    \row
        \li
        \code
        config_simulator:
             zones: { left : FrontLeft, right : FrontRight, rear: Rear }
        \endcode
        \li Accompanying YAML file
        \li Interface
        \li For the backend simulator defines a list of zones supported by the simulation code
        with their names
    \row
        \li \code
        config_simulator:
        default: AirflowDirection.Floor | AirflowDirection.Dashboard
        \endcode
        \li Accompanying YAML file
        \li Property
        \li Defines the initial values for the property returned by the simulator backend.
    \row
        \li \code
        config_simulator:
        minimum: 10
        \endcode
        \li Accompanying YAML file
        \li Property
        \li Defines the minimum value for integer and real properties, generated code in the simulator backend will check for validity.
    \row
        \li \code
        config_simulator:
        maximum: 10
        \endcode
        \li Accompanying YAML file
        \li Property
        \li Defines the maximum value for integer and real properties, generated code in the simulator backend will check for validity.
    \row
        \li \code
        config_simulator:
        range: [10, 20]
        \endcode
        \li Accompanying YAML file
        \li Property
        \li Defines the range value for integer and real properties, generated code in the simulator backend will check for validity.
    \row
        \li \code

        domain: {10, 20, 30}
        \endcode
        \li Accompanying YAML file
        \li Property
        \li Defines the possible values for the property, generated code in the simulator backend will check for validity.
